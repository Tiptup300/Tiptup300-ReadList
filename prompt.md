I want just one subsection to be generated (the one with the asterisk)

Please write with a narrative structure, come from an interesting and mysterious storytelling perspective and be speaking to an interested but mature reader.

For writing style, prefer styles similar to The Goldfinch, Donna Tart.

Now please generate a chapter of text for this long form article. 

If the section might require multiple subsections, make the first paragraph summarize and lead the structure of the chapter, but do not explicitly say "this section will be about", be subtle. 

Start with a level three heading with the title of the section

Every three or four paragraphs mix in a visual descriptions and details where appropriate.

Add an additional paragraph at the end that segues cleanly into the next subsection.
