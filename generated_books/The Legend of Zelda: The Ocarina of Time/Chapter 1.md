## Chapter 1

### 1.A. The Boy Without a Fairy
It is strange, the way absence can hum louder than presence—how silence, when fixed to a single place or person, begins to accumulate its own texture. In the village where I grew up, everything had its pairings, its mirrored halves: the endless green married to the whispering wind, the mossy bridges paired with the water running beneath them, the children with their fairies. Except me. The others darted about with those motes of light, their tiny companions tracing arcs of gold through the air like a signature only they could read. I had nothing. I remember—no, I feel—the space where one should have been, a quiet pocket at my shoulder where an invisible weight refused to settle. It made people look at me the way they might study a crack in an otherwise perfect vase.

The days themselves were a tangle of dappled sunlight and suspicion. Children pretended not to notice, but their games always stopped just before I arrived, and then started up again when I passed. The adults smiled too long, as though overcompensating for some private conclusion they had already reached. I pretended it didn’t matter, but in truth, the lack became a constant lens through which I saw the world—one that sharpened edges and deepened shadows. Sometimes I would lie on my back and watch the canopy sway, trying to imagine what my fairy would be like if it existed, whether it would be impatient or wise, or—worse—indifferent.

Morning mists made the village look older than it was, as if it had been here long before the forest itself. Dew clung to the rope bridges, and the air smelled faintly of wet bark and something sweeter beneath, a scent that could almost make you believe in destiny. In those moments, I half-suspected that my condition—if that’s the word—was less a curse and more a kind of waiting. But waiting for what? The answer never came, only the shifting green, the sound of others laughing somewhere out of sight, and that persistent, almost physical sense of vacancy beside me.

It is only in hindsight, years later, that I began to understand that emptiness is rarely empty at all. Often it is the first sign of something vast drawing near, too large to be seen until it is almost upon you. And as that day unfolded, the forest seemed to hold its breath, the very air thickening as though the world itself had leaned in to listen.

The next morning, the Great Deku Tree summoned me.

### 1.B The Death of the Great Deku Tree

I remember the air that morning as something almost too still, as if the forest itself had paused mid-breath. You’d think the hush of a place like Kokiri Woods would be a comfort—birdsong soft as brushstrokes, the scent of moss rising from the roots—but that day it felt wrong, like the forest was listening for something it didn’t want to hear. There was a kind of brightness to the light filtering through the leaves, a luminous green haze, yet beneath it ran an unspoken dread. The Great Deku Tree had summoned me. Even now, I can’t decide if I went as a child eager for adventure or as a child being led, unknowingly, to a graveside.

Approaching him was always strange, as though I were moving toward a presence rather than a shape—though of course, his shape was impossible to ignore: roots thick as bridges, bark patterned like the deep grooves of an old man’s hands, that wide and solemn mouth half-parted in perpetual speech. I remember thinking he looked different that morning. Not diminished exactly, but dimmed, like a candle still burning but near the end of its wax. His voice, when it came, was soft enough to make the leaves quiver. He told me of a curse, of something foul lodged deep inside him, a sickness that had taken root in his heartwood. And as he spoke, I had the ridiculous, almost guilty sense that I was hearing the confession of someone who had already decided not to be saved.

It is strange how clearly I can recall the smell—the dry, resinous perfume that always seemed to float from him, laced now with something bitter, like sap scorched on a fire. Going inside him was nothing like I had imagined in the half-formed daydreams of a child who’d heard older Kokiri whisper of the mysteries within. The air was damp, dim, pulsing faintly with life and decay, the sound of my footsteps muted by a carpet of fibrous roots underfoot. I remember each battle with the strange, twisting creatures inside him—how they didn’t seem like invaders so much as fever-born phantoms. By the time I reached the source, it felt less like I was defeating something than like I was trying to persuade it to leave.

When I emerged again into the light, victorious in the way children think victory is supposed to work, I half-expected him to straighten, to let out some great rejuvenating sigh. Instead, there was only the rustle of the canopy and his voice, lower now, a weight pressing each word into me. He spoke of the past and the future as though they were the same thing—of the boy without a fairy, of a destiny he had been waiting to pass on like a sealed letter. There was a moment when he looked—though he had no eyes—as if he were seeing me and someone else at once. And then, with a sound that was more absence than noise, the life left him. The leaves above seemed to wilt in sympathy, their edges already tinged with the first whisper of autumn.

I stood there far too long after the others had gone, staring at the great hollow trunk that now seemed like a monument more than a guardian. I thought about how something so immense could vanish so quietly, and how easily the living can slip into the role of memory. It was only when a sudden wind shivered the treetops—bringing with it the distant gleam of sunlit fields—that I remembered there was a larger world beyond Kokiri Woods. Somewhere out there, a castle stood, and within it a princess who had already begun to fear the shadow on the horizon.

### 1.C. The First Glimpse of Hyrule

There is a particular kind of air that lives only in the spaces between departure and arrival—thin, metallic, and humming faintly, as if a string somewhere in the sky had been plucked and was still trembling. I felt it the moment I stepped past the last tangled roots of the forest, the shadowed canopy dissolving into a wash of open light. It wasn’t so much that the trees ended, but that the world began. The ground itself seemed different—less springy, more deliberate, as though it remembered the weight of countless footsteps and the decisions that had brought them here. Behind me, the woods were breathing in their damp, leaf-laden darkness; before me, the air was dry, saltless, carrying the far-off dust of something vast.

The land spread outward in a green so wide it seemed to have no edge—just an unfurling, like a sheet shaken out by invisible hands. The sky was a different thing entirely from the patchwork glimpses I’d known beneath the branches; here it was a dome without ceiling, a pale-blue expanse so bright it almost hurt to look at. The sun—blunt, unwavering—sat heavy in the upper air, bleaching the stones near my feet and casting sharp, black shadows that made everything look cut from paper. There was a tower in the distance, pale against the horizon, its lines too straight to be anything but deliberate. I remember thinking, absurdly, that it looked like the spine of an animal, the rest of its body buried beneath the earth.

I stood there longer than I meant to, adjusting to the sensation of space pressing in from all sides. The forest had been a cradle, its boundaries soft and implicit, but this was something else entirely—this was the unsettling generosity of a world that would not protect you from itself. My ears caught new sounds layered over the wind: the faint clink of metal from somewhere unseen, the liquid murmur of water breaking against stone, a long, intermittent call that might have been a bird or a man at a great distance. It occurred to me, not for the first time, how fragile the mind feels when it meets something it has no prior image for, and how quickly we try to give it one.

The path downward curved along a ridge, worn smooth by years of quiet traffic, and I walked with the wary excitement of someone stepping into a painting they’ve been studying for years—suddenly aware that the colors are thicker, the edges less exact, and that the air smells faintly of smoke in a way no image could have suggested. Every few steps I would look up again, half expecting the scene to change, as if the castle and the plains and the river that cut between them were just a mirage that might dissolve at any moment.

Somewhere far ahead, the glint of water caught the light—quick, silver flashes that hinted at a boundary I could not yet see. I remember thinking of the princess’s words from days before, though she had not yet spoken them to me; they were more of a feeling than a memory, a premonition stitched into the moment. That sense of inevitability clung to the horizon as I descended toward it, each step carrying me closer to the point where innocence would become something more deliberate, and far less forgiving.

### 1.D. The Princess’s Warning

It was an afternoon of such impossible clarity that the clouds seemed more like smudges of chalk than living things. The castle courtyard was silent save for the faint shudder of banners in the wind—white fabric tremoring against stone like the last breath of a thought. I remember my palms were damp, though the air was cool. That was before I understood that fear has nothing to do with heat, and everything to do with the slow press of inevitability.

She was smaller than I had imagined, the princess—no older than myself, yet with eyes that carried a depth I had only seen in weathered elders or riverbeds cut deep by centuries. They were a shade of blue that seemed impossible in nature, except perhaps in the cold shadow of dawn. She spoke softly, her words carrying the kind of gravity that makes you lean in, as if listening closer might make them less true. I don’t recall exactly when the wind began to pick up, but it was just as she began to speak of omens: a dark man from the desert, a face that never betrayed warmth, a gaze that sought the crown not for its gold, but for the dominion it promised.

The smell of fresh rain was in the air, though there was no rain. Somewhere beyond the courtyard walls, a bird cried out once, sharply, and then silence swallowed it. She told me she had seen him—Ganondorf—kneeling in the throne room with a posture of submission so precise it seemed rehearsed. Yet in his eyes, a different truth: hunger, endless and without kindness. There was an image in my mind, unbidden—a wolf circling a campfire, not for warmth, but for the sleepers who trusted it.

Her voice shifted as she spoke of dreams—visions she swore were sent by the goddesses themselves. A dark cloud swallowing Hyrule, villages burning in the night, the laughter of something not entirely human. She described it the way one might recall a smell from childhood: with visceral precision, yet tinged with doubt as to whether it had been real or imagined. There was something in her words that unsettled me—not the prophecy itself, but the way she seemed certain it had already begun.

I remember the way the light fell across her face, the way the sharp shadow of the window lattice cut her features into fragments, as though the sun itself wasn’t sure she could be trusted whole. I remember wondering if she was telling me this because she believed I could help—or because she knew no one else would listen.

And then, as though the moment had decided it could not linger, she pressed a small object into my hand: a note, folded so precisely that the edges aligned like the walls of a fortress. She told me not to speak of this to anyone, especially not to the king. I wanted to ask why, but something in her expression—an almost imperceptible tightening at the corner of her mouth—warned me that some answers carry their own dangers.

When I left the courtyard, the air was heavier, though no storm had yet formed. I had the faint sense that the shadows had lengthened without the sun moving at all. That was the last time I saw her in the light of peace. The next time, the air would smell of smoke.

### 1.E — The Stones of Elemental Power

It is strange, now, to think how small they seemed in my hands—three quiet fragments of the world’s first breath, each no larger than the polished river stones I used to skip across the Kokiri shallows. Yet in their weight—if weight is even the right word—there was a kind of pressure, as if they had been gathering silence for centuries, only to release it into the marrow of whoever dared hold them. I remember the first time I saw one, its surface catching the light in a way that made my eyes ache, as though it was reflecting not the sun above us, but a sun buried far beneath the earth.

They came to me one by one, each along a path paved with uncertainty and half-seen truths. The Kokiri’s Emerald was first—deep green, almost black at its heart, smelling faintly of moss and wet wood when the rain fell on it. I still recall the sound of the forest that day, the wind low and hesitant, the leaves stirring as if in warning. I had not yet learned that every gift in this life carries a demand in return, though the Great Deku Tree’s fading breath should have been enough to teach me. It was his parting bequest, and I carried it as though it were an ember in the hollow of my chest, warming and burning in equal measure.

The Goron’s Ruby was another matter entirely—hot to the touch, even through the cloth I wrapped it in. It was the kind of heat that seemed to seep into thought itself, quickening the pulse, narrowing the mind to something fierce and impatient. I remember Darunia’s solemn nod as he handed it over, the cavern around us rumbling in a way that felt more like a warning than coincidence. The ruby was red not just in color, but in temperament; there was a violence in it, restrained, but restless. Carrying it, I began to dream of mountains cracking open, of rivers of fire eating the sky.

Then there was the Zora’s Sapphire—clear and cold as glacial water, the sort that numbs the hands until they are no longer your own. It did not burn or press upon me the way the others had; it was instead a slow, patient seep into the bones, a clarity that felt dangerously close to detachment. Ruto’s eyes had been fierce when she entrusted it to me, though there was an undercurrent of something else—resignation, perhaps, or the brittle pride of someone giving away more than they can bear. Even now I can recall the way the light fractured within it, as if it contained not one reflection of me, but countless, each staring back with a slightly different expression.

I sometimes wonder whether the Stones knew each other—whether, in the dark sleep of their keeping places, they remembered the weight of being together. Holding all three at once was not triumph; it was dissonance. The green pressed down like the shadowed canopy, the red surged upward like a furnace, the blue pulled away, outward, into some deep distance. I kept them close nonetheless, bound in cloth and silence, their combined presence tightening around me like a net. It is no small thing to be the keeper of forces that have no master.

It was with the Stones in my possession that I first felt the edges of the next threshold. The wind shifted in Hyrule Field; the castle’s towers looked sharper, more brittle against the sky. There was a sense—small, but insistent—that something was already moving toward me, and that the Stones were not just keys, but invitations. The path ahead was no longer one I could walk with a child’s steps. The air itself seemed to hum with the promise of doors that could only be opened once, and never closed again.

### 1.F — Zelda’s Escape and Ganondorf’s Betrayal

It began in that peculiar hour just before the sun tips the horizon, when the streets of the castle town seem suspended in amber. I remember the air being oddly still, as though the cobblestones themselves were holding their breath, waiting for something—someone—to arrive. The weight of it pressed down on me with the same queasy familiarity as before a storm, that strange interval when the mind cannot decide whether it’s dread or anticipation it feels. And in the midst of it came the hoofbeats, urgent and sharp, ringing against the walls like iron-tipped warnings.

She emerged from the northern gate with the same impossible clarity I’ve sometimes seen in dreams: Zelda, her hair unbound and whipping in the wind, her small gloved hands clutching the reins with an urgency that banished the softness from her features. Behind her, Impa’s broad shoulders cut a dark shape against the pale morning, the two of them fused into a single purpose. They did not look at me. Or perhaps they couldn’t—already fixed on whatever lay beyond my narrow place in the story. That, I think, hurt more than I could admit at the time.

From the shadowed archway came the second rider, and here the world seemed to alter its texture. Ganondorf’s presence did not simply take up space; it warped it, as if the air itself became denser around him. I could smell the faint tang of scorched earth before he drew close—an odor too real for any trick of the mind. His armor caught the newborn light in jagged gleams, and his eyes… I have no vocabulary for them except to say they were not looking *at* Zelda so much as *through* her, as though she were the final keyhole between him and what he desired.

It strikes me now that betrayal never announces itself with the flourish of horns or the ceremony of a staged treachery. Instead, it moves quietly at first, an undercurrent running beneath the surface of daily gestures, until the moment it becomes visible—and by then it’s already too late. Watching him that morning, I recognized something terrible: that his pursuit was not sudden. It was the conclusion of countless small decisions, each one placed carefully where no one would think to notice, until they formed a corridor leading only here.

The clatter of his steed’s hooves faded as he vanished beyond the gate, swallowed by the dust that still hung in Zelda’s wake. I stood rooted to the spot, feeling as though I had witnessed something both inevitable and entirely avoidable—a contradiction I could not reconcile. The silence that followed was more dangerous than the chase itself. It was the sound of the world shifting underfoot, the awareness that the ground you’ve always trusted might no longer hold.

And then—though I cannot explain why—I turned not to follow, but to look back toward the castle, still looming in the gold-pale light. Its windows reflected nothing of what had just happened; they sat blank and unknowing, like the face of a liar who believes their own story. That image has stayed with me, though by nightfall it would be replaced by another, more devastating one: the stone doors of the Temple of Time yawning open, and the shadow of my own choices stretching ahead into darkness.
